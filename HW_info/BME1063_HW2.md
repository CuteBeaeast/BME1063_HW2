# Homework â€“week3 (No.2) : (You have 3 weeks to finish this homework)

**Due: 2020-April-30 (1pm before class)**

 

Format: Email Report and associated code/commands sent to TA.

Write up: can be English or Chinese. 

 

## Description

The goal is to figure out which transcription activator (A or B) plays a more important role in cancer by examine the RNAi knockdown expression profile by microarray, and show me the results how you get that conclusion. 

 

The experiments were performed on human cancer cell lines, and the microarray platform used is [HuGene-2_0-st] Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 ST Array. There are 9 samples, three control RNAi experiments, three replicates for each targeting A and B transcription activators separately. The data can be accessed at /public/home/zhangly/class/2-class/class4/homework2.

 

## What should be included in the writeup:

1. All your code to process the data.  

2. A writeup explain how you came to the conclusion, which is more important and why. The evidence should be figures or tables. 

3. [optional] by performing differential expression analysis or any other analysis you can come up with, figure out how does factor A or B promote cancer progression. 

4. [optional] Try to figure out a way to guess which gene is A/B based on any idea you have?
